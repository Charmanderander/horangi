How to use:

1. Configure the path outputs in "config.txt"
2. Put the log file in the input folder
3. Run the python script "logAnalyzer.py"

If the program runs correctly, check the output folder.
It should have the following files:

1. A text file showing unqiue IP addresses
2. A pipe delimited text file showing the IP addresses, the number of times it appears, and the country of origin
3. A folder called "activity", which contains multiple text files of each IP address, and their related network activity


Attack Detection:

Run "attackDetection.py"

The output of the scripts give 3 files:

3. WebShells.txt

In these files, each entry contains the IP address and activity log that is suspected to be an attack.
