DEVELOPER GUIDE

In "attackDetection.py"

Checking is done by simple word matching.
For each activity file, we scan through to check for

1. SQL injections (Checks on word "Union")
2. Remote file inclusions (Checks on word "/etc/passwd")
3. Webshells (Checks on words "r57","loaderz","c0derz","c99","kadot","h4ntu")

The words can be modified to dictate how strict the checks are.
Adding more checks can lead to a higher computation rate and a higher rate of false positives.
