Script that reads apache logs line by line and returns the following information to file(s): 

1. list of unique IP addresses as a flat text file

2. list of unique IP addresses with country and number of hits as a flat text file 

3. list of all activity per IP address to individual flat text files per IP

4. detect SQLi with found entries to flat text file

5. detect remote file inclusion with found entries to flat text file

6. detect web shells with found entries to flat text file


Packages Used:

Python-geoip: returns the geolocation of target IP address
http://pythonhosted.org/python-geoip/

How to use:

1. Configure the path outputs in "config.txt"
2. Put the log file in the input folder
3. Run the python script "logAnalyzer.py"

Outputs:

If the program runs correctly, check the output folder.
It should have the following files:

1. A text file showing unqiue IP addresses
2. A pipe delimited text file showing the IP addresses, the number of times it appears, and the country of origin
3. A folder called "activity", which contains multiple text files of each IP address, and their related network activity


Attack detection:

Checking is done by simple word matching.
For each activity file, we scan through to check for

1. SQL injections (Checks on word "Union")
2. Remote file inclusions (Checks on word "/etc/passwd")
3. Webshells (Checks on words "r57","loaderz","c0derz","c99","kadot","h4ntu")

The words can be modified to dictate how strict the checks are.
Adding more checks can lead to a higher computation rate and a higher rate of false positives.


The output of the scripts give 3 files:

1. SQLi.txt
2. RemoteFileInclusion.txt
3. WebShells.txt

In these files, each entry contains the IP address and activity log that is suspected to be an attack.
